This is a copy of the excellent [Glitch Works XT-IDE](https://github.com/glitchwrks/xt_ide) which adds a few minor but important features which make building an approximation of a hardcard, based on XT-IDE, much simpler.

TODO:
* Add 2 extra mounting holes opposite the existing mounting holes so that the controller can be secured to a metal back plate in four locations instead of two.
* Add a mini-molex connector so that a full size 3.5" IDE spinner can be powered directly off the controller card without using a molex connector from the power supply.
